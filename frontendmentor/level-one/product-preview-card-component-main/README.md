## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was great to review working with loading google fonts and rendering different layouts based on different screen sizes.

A couple other things I learned:
- Preventing grid blowout
- Transforming text to all caps using CSS
- Letter spacing (I had wrongly thought to use kerning)
