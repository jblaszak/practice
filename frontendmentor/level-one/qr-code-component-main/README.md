## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Challenge was pretty simple, learned a bit more about CSS resets to get the page to show full height. I did it more for time management practice to estimate how long it would take. Spent a little too much time fiddling trying to get sizing right. Would have been much faster with some design files.
