## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a fun one. Using multiple backgrounds was new for me. It was more involved/challenging than the previous components, which was nice!
Had to use transformsfor position and box shadows as well! Had difficulty with the overall page background positioning. Looked at some other solutions for it and found a way that worked. Also learned that
the CSS reset for img's was messing up the expected behaviour! Had to reset this to 'initial'!

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
