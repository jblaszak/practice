## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Learned more about DOM manipulation with javascript and styling radio buttons!  Also implemented some more semantic tags and aria labels. Had some challenges with positioning of text a lower baseline, could set more padding but that is inconsistent when there's more than one line. Will need to find a better solution to this.
